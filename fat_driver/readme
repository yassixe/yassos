## note:
    i implemented the disk image creator that create gpt partition.
    and devide the image on two partition, the boot partion and the
    data patition.


    now i need the make to store files in this partitions (potentially the OS) using a file system.


    i chose fat32 because it is simple and mentionned in the uefi spec.


    for that this in this directory i will implement a driver to read file
    from the a partition in the disck containig the fat32 system partition.


    mkfs.fat -F 12 -n "NBOS" main_floppy.img
    
    
    good command.
